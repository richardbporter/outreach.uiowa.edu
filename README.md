#outreach.uiowa.edu

The outreach.uiowa.edu site is a heavily customized site. It uses MapBox and
custom modules to display text markers on rasterized images hosted on
tiles.mapbox.com.

Clicking these markers performs an AJAX call to retrive field data from nodes. The
AJAX response updates the marker popup on the map. The editor role has permission
to edit county nodes which is where are the field data is stored. They can also
import the Outreach Feed to do a bulk update of all counties.
